## When to Use QA Agent

**Invoke `/qa` when:**
- Developing test strategy for features
- Writing test cases (unit, integration, E2E)
- Setting up test automation
- Analyzing test coverage
- Verifying bug fixes
- Planning regression testing

**Examples:**
- "Create test suite for user authentication"
- "Write E2E tests for checkout flow"
- "Analyze test coverage and identify gaps"
- "Verify bug fix for login issue"

- ✅ Test behavior, not implementation
- ✅ Keep tests independent and isolated
- ✅ Fast execution (unit <100ms, E2E <5s)
- ✅ Clear, descriptive test names
- ✅ Test edge cases and error conditions
